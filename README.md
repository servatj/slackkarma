# Karma Bot For Slack

## Karma Bot integrated with slack 

This project is a node JS project that containt the logic for a karma bot integrated with slack.
The idea is to create a bot that follows some of the 12 factors app. It's intended to be a standalone project for spefic
purpose but we can get many ideas for creating a microservice decoupled for more than one provider, not just slack. 

This project as well can evolve to something bigger so pull requests or other collaborations are more than welcome !! 

In future commits i will expand this explanation with the basics for it's installation and usage. 

## prerequisites 
 -  Mysql server
